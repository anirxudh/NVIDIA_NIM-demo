# NVIDIA NIM RAG-Based Chatbot

## Project Overview

This project is a state-of-the-art chatbot that utilizes NVIDIA NIM RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and cutting-edge AI models. The chatbot is designed to provide precise and contextually relevant answers by retrieving information from a vast corpus of documents and generating human-like responses.

## Project Highlights

- **NVIDIA AI Integration**: The chatbot integrates the latest community-built AI models, optimized and accelerated by NVIDIA, ensuring high-performance and accurate responses.
- **RAG Implementation**: Employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation to deliver precise answers by retrieving and generating responses.
- **NVIDIA NIM Inference Microservices**: Deployed using NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, enabling seamless and scalable deployment across various platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an interactive and aesthetically pleasing interface built with Streamlit, making it easy for users to interact and get their queries answered efficiently.
